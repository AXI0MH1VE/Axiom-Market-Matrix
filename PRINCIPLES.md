# Core Principles

## Overview

The Axiom Market Matrix platform is built on fundamental principles that guide its design, implementation, and operation. These principles ensure robust, reliable, and profitable algorithmic trading while maintaining the highest standards of risk management and ethical operation.

## 1. Risk-First Design Philosophy

### Capital Preservation
- **Primary Objective**: Protect capital before seeking profit
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Never exceed 15% portfolio drawdown
- **Position Sizing**: Risk no more than 2% per trade
- **Diversification**: Maintain exposure across uncorrelated assets

### Risk Management Hierarchy
1. **Portfolio Level**: Overall exposure and correlation management
2. **Strategy Level**: Individual strategy risk limits and stop-losses
3. **Position Level**: Size limits and exit rules
4. **Order Level**: Slippage and execution risk controls

```python
# Risk Management Example
class RiskManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.max_portfolio_risk = 0.15
        self.max_position_risk = 0.02
        self.correlation_limit = 0.7
        
    def validate_trade(self, trade, portfolio):
        if self.calculate_portfolio_risk(trade, portfolio) > self.max_portfolio_risk:
            return False, "Portfolio risk exceeded"
        return True, "Trade approved"
```
